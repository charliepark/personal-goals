# Week of May 4th

_Week in Review:_ So, work-wise, was a really strong week. Things are flowing; it feels like we're shipping a lot. Stayed off Twitter, and that felt really good. Got accepted to speak at Ignite; really excited about that. Frustrated by lack of time / progress on PB, but that's almost 100% attributable to how much outside-of-work time I'm thinking about work. Will try to block out some time for PB this week, but that feels a little naive / overly optimistic.

#### This week's focus: Ship a ton at work; get wizard wrapped up in PB
