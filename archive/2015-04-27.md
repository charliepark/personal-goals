# Week of April 27th

*Week in Review:* Things went really well. Being off Twitter is awesome. Things at work are feeling really "flowy". Missed one talk deadline because of confusion over deadline (midnight in Amsterdam, vs. Pacific), but got in an idea for Ignite here in CA. We'll see how that goes, but excited about it.
