# Week of March 23rd

**Week in Review:** Progressed well, though didn't put enough of a priority on wrapping up taxes. With Yosemite this coming weekend, that needs to be a priority, early this week. Email went well, fwiw. Had a good day working on Braintree integration on Saturday. SStill needs some time (4 hours?), but it's on its way.
