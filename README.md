# Personal Goals

Inspired by https://github.com/una/personal-goals

Personal goals made open source for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching goals for 2015: Focus, Ship, Communicate

1. Do excellent work at IFTTT. Improve communication around project status, deadlines.
2. Ship the new version of PearBudget.
3. Speak at a front-end conference.
4. People before Process before Product.
5. Side projects are a second-order release valve. Better to focus on primaries. Wrap up projects that don't help me flourish. Don't start inessential distractions.
6. Use what platform I have to help raise profiles of others.
7. Have fun.

- [ ] Blog post: Queueing off https://twitter.com/csswizardry/status/578870052516151296, there are (at least) two different type of projects CSS is written for — 1. content sites and 2. apps. And for a long time, the people writing the articles and books and talks about how to write CSS were the people who were writing the CSS for _content sites_. Therefore, a lot of the best practices were for that type of interface. Blogs have two things that make them stand out as distinct from apps: 1. They have a _really_ simple DOM; 2. Once it's written, the designer isn't actively changeing the CSS, and the content of the author generally isn't interested in adding classes to their code. So that approach made sense. But apps require a very different approach. (Also note how on simple sites — blipnote, for example — I still use content-site-like CSS.)
- [ ] Blog post: "women" vs "females" (also "girls" and "ladies") "A Few Operating Instructions for Dudes"
  - note irony of engineers, who are so focused on symantics in their day-to-day life, getting it wrong
  - note that it's usually unintentional, but hints at 
  - probleatic in the same way as someone saying "a gay" or "a Black" or whatever (adjective as noun). Reduces a person down to one facet, and presumes that, because they have that attribute, they are representative of that group, or that that group is even representable in the way they're implying.
  - Why "girl" in so many names of woman-oriented programs?
    - language sucks; not many great, casual words for women (contrast with "guys", "men", "dudes", "bros"; what equivalents are there? "sisters" implies more familiarity / closeness (note: no "code brothers"). "woman" can sound dowdy or marmish, "girl" sounds juvenile; our culture puts a premium on youth, and the women with time and energy to coordinate these often have those because they don't have some of the attributes society normally assigns to "women" (advanced degree, advanced career, spouse, kids), so, until recently, haven't been as quick to adopt the mantle of "woman", so "girl" usually gets preference); but it all gets back to language being frustratingly bad at this.
    - a form of signaling (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)) - conveying the attitude and ideal composition of the group's identity
    - ends up as a penalty on the groups, as it creates confusion: is this aimed at literal girls (http://appcamp4girls.com/) or metaphorical girls, possibly mid-career (http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Geek-Dinners-Melbourne/)?
      - penalty 1: women looking for groups have to work harder to filter out noise
      - penalty 2: employers looking at resumes have to parse the org and know what it is; many won't
      - penalty 3: because "girl" is a diminuitive, employers will consciously or unconsciously devalue it on the name alone
    - BUT! AND THIS IS IMPORTANT! Women are fully in their rights to name their organizations, meetups, programs, etc. things with "girl" in the title.
