# Personal Goals

Inspired by https://github.com/una/personal-goals

Personal goals made open source for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching goals for 2015: Focus, Ship, Communicate

1. Do excellent work at IFTTT. Improve communication around project status, deadlines.
2. Ship the new version of PearBudget.
3. Speak at a front-end conference.
4. People before Process before Product.
5. Side projects are a second-order release valve. Better to focus on primaries. Wrap up projects that don't help me flourish. Don't start inessential distractions.
6. Use what platform I have to help raise profiles of others.
7. Have fun.

- [ ] Blog post: Queueing off https://twitter.com/csswizardry/status/578870052516151296, there are (at least) two different type of projects CSS is written for — 1. content sites and 2. apps. And for a long time, the people writing the articles and books and talks about how to write CSS were the people who were writing the CSS for _content sites_. Therefore, a lot of the best practices were for that type of interface. Blogs have two things that make them stand out as distinct from apps: 1. They have a _really_ simple DOM; 2. Once it's written, the designer isn't actively changeing the CSS, and the content of the author generally isn't interested in adding classes to their code. So that approach made sense. But apps require a very different approach. (Also note how on simple sites — blipnote, for example — I still use content-site-like CSS.)
- [ ] Gist-as-CMS - make one, focused on "doing"
- [ ] Blog post: An explanation of Gist-as-CMS
- [ ] Blog post: Wrapup on The Measure
- [ ] Blog post: Wrapup on The 276
- [ ] Blog post: More Like This and why I'm not doing it
- [ ] Blog post: looking into why men make jokes back at women on Twitter, etc.
  - these are early draft notes, so if you read this on GitHub, know it's still a WIP
  - a misguided attempt at platonic affection?
  - guys banter with other guys, a back-and-forth, playful
  - example: screenshot from Slack of "hot cha cha" restaurant banter with Andy; probably no original jokes in it, but it was an "in the moment, we're having fun together" thing
  - example: https://twitter.com/lara_hogan/status/616603320766070784, tempted to say "snack overflow"; works in a few ways, actually pretty good; more important to me to not manjoke, so didn't say anything
  - example: talk of Steve Jobs movie, with Shiva's joke about Christian Bale. I approached first with the idea of making a Spiderman joke; then saw Shiva's comment about CB. My brain took that as validation, that I was in the right direction, and maybe it'd be funniner if I made a "gritty reboot" joke. But was that Shiva's joke? That is, was Shiva's comment a joke? Or just a comment? If he was making the same general joke, mine would have been kind of weak. But maybe CB really was in the running, and Fassbender got the role? I don't know! Didn't end up commenting there. (Also, checking with Shiva)
