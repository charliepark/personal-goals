# Personal Goals

Inspired by https://github.com/una/personal-goals

Personal goals made open source for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching goals for 2015: Focus, Ship, Communicate

1. Do excellent work at IFTTT. Improve communication around project status, deadlines.
2. Ship the new version of PearBudget.
3. Speak at a front-end conference.
4. People before Process before Product.
5. Side projects are a second-order release valve. Better to focus on primaries. Wrap up projects that don't help me flourish. Don't start inessential distractions.
6. Use what platform I have to help raise profiles of others.
7. Have fun.

- [ ] Blog post: Queueing off https://twitter.com/csswizardry/status/578870052516151296, there are (at least) two different type of projects CSS is written for — 1. content sites and 2. apps. And for a long time, the people writing the articles and books and talks about how to write CSS were the people who were writing the CSS for _content sites_. Therefore, a lot of the best practices were for that type of interface. Blogs have two things that make them stand out as distinct from apps: 1. They have a _really_ simple DOM; 2. Once it's written, the designer isn't actively changeing the CSS, and the content of the author generally isn't interested in adding classes to their code. So that approach made sense. But apps require a very different approach. (Also note how on simple sites — blipnote, for example — I still use content-site-like CSS.)
