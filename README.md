# Personal Goals

Inspired by https://github.com/una/personal-goals

Personal goals made open source for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching goals for 2015: Focus, Ship

1. Do excellent work at IFTTT. Improve communication around project status, deadlines.
2. Ship the new version of PearBudget.
3. Speak at a front-end conference.
4. People before Process before Product.
5. Side projects are a second-order release valve. Better to focus on primaries. Wrap up projects that don't help me flourish. Dont' start inessential distractions.
6. Use what platform I have to help raise profiles of others.
7. Have fun.
